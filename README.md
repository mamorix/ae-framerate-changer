After Effects script to change the framerate for multiple footages and compositions instantly

*Using this script to change framerate is the same as interpreting footage and changing the fps value. 

*Running this script without any bin items selected will interpret footage for all items in your bin.

*Selecting one or more footages/compositions before running the script will interpret the footage for those bin items alone.
